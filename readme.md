# URL-Shortener

The goal of this project is to shorten the long url with the help of base62 conversion and mysql database. Short codes for url is generated by concatenating host address and encoded string , provided as output by base62 conversion function

## Requirements
- flask
- String
- math
- pymysql

## Steps for shortening the long urls provided by  user

### Step 1:
Create a database 'url' and connect the flask application to mysql database by using pymysql.

### Step 2:
Write a function that will take any decimal number as input and convert them into base62 encoded string.

### Step 3:
Create an endpoint that will accept long url through query string, and store the requested url in mysql database.

### Step 4:
Take the lastrow id in which long url has been stored and pass that row id as parameter to base62 conversion function which will convert decimal numbers into base62 characters

### Step 5:
Generate short by concatenating the host address and encoded string, provided as output by base62 conversion function

### Step 6:
Update the short url in database where long url has been stored and finally the table contains short url corresponding to long url.

### Step 7:
Create an endpoint that will accept generated short url and redirects the short url to long url
by selecting the long url where corresponding short url has been saved in mysql


Refer the working code - tiny_url.py

Current project generated user-friendly short urls that are easier to share than long urls. Short urls are more convinent
to remember.
